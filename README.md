# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) for Instacart, an online grocery service. The objective of the analysis is to derive insights from customer purchasing patterns and to help inform targeted marketing strategies for Instacart stakeholders. The stakeholders are particularly interested in customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior to improve ad targeting, scheduling, and campaign effectiveness.

## Objective
Instacart seeks to better understand its customer base and their buying behavior to enhance marketing efforts. The main questions guiding this project include:
1. What are the busiest days and hours of the week for orders?
2. Are there specific times when customers spend the most?
3. What product categories are the most popular?
4. How can customer loyalty and demographic information inform targeted campaigns?

## Data
This project uses open-source datasets provided by Instacart. The data includes customer order history, product details, and information on purchase frequency across various departments.

## Tools and Libraries
The analysis and visualizations are implemented in Python, using the following libraries:

Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy for numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
SciPy for statistical analysis.
Jupyter Notebook for code development and presentation.

## Key Steps
Data Cleaning: Ensured consistency by fixing missing values, handling duplicates, and converting data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Explored customer behavior across multiple dimensions, such as time of purchase, order value, and product preferences.
Data Visualization: Created visualizations to identify key trends and patterns, such as busiest order times, popular product categories, and customer loyalty metrics.
Customer Segmentation: Derived new columns and customer groupings based on loyalty status, region, and ordering frequency.
Insights and Recommendations: Provided actionable insights for Instacartâ€™s marketing and sales teams to improve targeted advertising.
